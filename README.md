**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** The logical regression model's predications are fairly accurate for healthy loans(0). Our model shows a precision rate of 100% with 99% recall. High risk loans(1) have a precision rate of 85% with 91% recall. This could be subjected to a small population size as indicated by the support. Healthy loans have a bigger feature size therefore, it better represents the large dataset.

###Overview
The overall purpose of this analysis is to use a supervised machine learning model to analyze healthy loans and high risk loans in the given dataset called "lending_data.csv". This dataset is comprised of Loan Size, Interest Rate, Borrower Income, Number of Accounts, Derogatory Mark and Total Debt. Using this information we will construct a logistic Regression model to predict Precision, Recall and f1 Score.
Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model. (5 points)

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. (10 points)

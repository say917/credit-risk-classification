**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** The logical regression model's predications are fairly accurate for healthy loans(0). Our model shows a precision rate of 100% with 99% recall. High risk loans(1) have a precision rate of 85% with 91% recall. This could be subjected to a small population size as indicated by the support. Healthy loans have a bigger feature size therefore, it better represents the large dataset.
